# Bass Model Project

## Overview

This project uses the **Bass Diffusion Model** to analyze the adoption of the Apple HomePod over time. The report examines how innovation and imitation affect the rate of adoption based on historical data.

## Contents

- **report/**
  - `Bass_Model.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing the Bass Diffusion Model analysis.
  - `Bass_Model.pdf`: The PDF version of the report generated from the R Markdown file.
  
- **data/**
  - `homepod_data.csv`: The dataset containing historical data about Apple HomePod adoption, used for modeling in the report.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to model and visualize the adoption curve for Apple HomePod, using the Bass Diffusion Model. The report helps to understand how various factors (like innovation and imitation) influence product adoption over time.

## Stages

- Implements the Bass Diffusion Model on Apple HomePod adoption data.
- Analyzes the adoption trends and estimates future adoption.
- Generates visualizations to explore the impact of model parameters.

## How to Use

1. Open the `Bass_Model.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Install required R packages.
3. Knit the R Markdown file to generate the report or view the provided PDF version (`Bass_Model.pdf`).
