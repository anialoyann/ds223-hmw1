  - `Bass_Model.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing the Bass Diffusion Model analysis.
  - `Bass_Model.pdf`: The PDF version of the report generated from the R Markdown file.
  
- **data/**
  - `homepod_data.csv`: The dataset containing historical data about Apple HomePod adoption, used for modeling in the report.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to use a Bass Diffusion model with the help of Apple HomePod to predict a diffusion path for a 2023 innovation Sonos Era 300 . 

## Stages

- Implements the Bass Diffusion Model on Apple HomePod adoption data.
- Analyzes the adoption trends and estimates future adoption.
- Generates visualizations to explore the impact of model parameters.
- Predicts the diffusion path for Sonos Era 300
- Estimates the number of adopters for Sonos Era 300

## How to Use

1. Open the `Bass_Model.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Install required R packages.
3. Knit the R Markdown file to generate the report or view the provided PDF version (`Bass_Model.pdf`).
